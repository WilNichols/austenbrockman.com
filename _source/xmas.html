You talked about wearing old clothes, not having bought yourself anything clothing-wise for the last year, wearing old underwear, Milo chewing them up. etc. Find somewhere online, fill out a shopping cart(s), and I'll buy a week's worth of new <oblique>whatever clothing</oblique> you choose. A lack of new things shouldn't be a stressor, and Milo's certainly taking a (literal) chunk out of the things you have.</p>
